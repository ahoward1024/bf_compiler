This is a brainfuck compiler.

The current compiler parses a .bf file for brainfuck characters, checks brainfuck syntax, and compiles a successful syntax check to a C program (build.c).

Currently, in order to run the compiler gcc must be installed on your machine and available in the system's PATH variable and only compiles a file named helloworld.bf. Added functionality to specify input and build files will be added eventually (and quite possibly the ability to select a C compiler of one's choice).
